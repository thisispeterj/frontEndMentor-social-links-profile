## My process

I began by reviewing both the desktop and mobile designs provided to begin thinking about how I would structure the HTML. I wanted it to be as semantic as possible and efficient as possible. I then reviewed the style guide and began to add the CSS styles, including the provided fonts, colors, and other style attributes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
